# Hello, I'm Riri ðŸ˜Š

I work as a Computer Programmer on a research project under the Department of Science and Technology (Philippines) where I and two other programmers are working to build a database and a website. I am currently learning more about frontend development and all kinds of cool stuff that has to do with the web. I like to read SF/F books ðŸ¤“ and watch anime or various western TV series ðŸ“º.
