# Hello!

My name is Riri. I work as a Computer Programmer on a research project under the Department of Science and Technology (Philippines) where I and two other programmers are working to build a database and a website. CSS fascinates me and I am currently learning more about frontend development. I like to read SF/F books ðŸ¤“ and watch anime or various western TV series.
