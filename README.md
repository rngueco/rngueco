# Hello!

My name is Riri. I work as a Science Research Assistant I at the University of the Philippines Baguio where I and two other programmers are working to build a database and website. CSS fascinates me and I am currently learning more about frontend development. I like to read SF/F books ðŸ¤“ and watch anime or various western TV series.
